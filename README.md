# Quiet Type

I love Tiddly, but Ill be honest. I dont want to have to learn another domain specific language to take advantage of its useful, self contained features. I just want a beautiful editor that works wherever I need it. And maybe this is petty, but I feel a little silly recommending something called tiddly to my friends and coworkers.

I love notion, but I want to go onto a mountain top with a chrome book and write. And I dont want to pay money.

I love obsidian, but I dont want to have to keep track of all the markdown files. 

So.. really, I'd like a single file, no-server, knowledge base, with a beautiful modern markdown editor, backlinks, and cool name. 

Inspired by Tiddly Wiki, Notion, and Obsidian, and using technology from the Pen editor, Quiet type helps writers, researchers, and developers keep their thoughts in one place, share them with others and not have to be a computer scientist to do so.
